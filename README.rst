Pyknot
======

Python (and optional Cython) modules for dealing with knotting and linking.

Pyknot is a work in progress, but in principle should support python2
and python3, and provide classes to help with knots and links as space
curves, detecting crossings, calculating and analysing knot invariants etc.
